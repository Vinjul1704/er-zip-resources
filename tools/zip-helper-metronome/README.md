# Zip Helper Metronome

A metronome software for performing zips, made by [hyp3rsomniac](https://www.twitch.tv/hyp3rsomniac).

Holding down the specified button will start the metronome, which helps you time the move input.

To use it, .NET 6 Desktop Runtime needs to be installed on your system, which can be found here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

You can also find a list of valid key names here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys?view=windowsdesktop-6.0

Keep in mind that the currently included binary and source do **not** match. The source of the latest binary is lost, however the one included is only a couple of commits older. From what hyp3rsomniac could recall, the only differences are minor attempts to improve accuracy that didn't actually do anything in the end.
