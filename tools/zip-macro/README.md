# Zip Macro (AHK)

An AutoHotKey macro for zip testing and routing.

It allows you to adjust the timings used for the zip, as well as which timing method to use, since different ones can behave and work better/worse on different systems (the default, "Mixed", is generally recommended).

Make sure you have AutoHotkey version 1.1 installed: https://www.autohotkey.com/
