# Zip Tools CT

A Cheat Engine table with various tools for zip testing and routing.

It includes:
- Fake zips: Execute a "fake zip" to quickly test setups and routing options, without having to rely on macros and stable performance. By default, it has hotkeys for medium shield zips at medium and heavy load with 7 move time ("Z" and "U" respectively), as well as one for a medium shield mega zip at heavy load, 7 move time and 12 extension wait time ("I").
- Zip timer: A tool to measure your input timings, so you can figure out why your zip failed.
- FPS counter: A simply FPS counter, which displays the only accurate FPS counter that's relevant for zips, since external overlays aren't accurate enough.
- Velocity measurement: An X/Y/Z velocity and movement value counter, which is useful for testing zip distances with different timings/setups and to double-check if you actually hit the correct distance you aimed for.
- QoL: The CE also adds a compact mode toggle to the top bar, as well as a value logger, which can be used for FPS logging.

Since it's a Cheat Engine table, you need to install Cheat Engine (make sure you say no to all software recommendations during installation!): https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php

It is also highly recommended to set the update interval 10 ms or lower in "Edit > Settings > Update interval", otherwise you might not catch things like unstable FPS.

Make sure you tick the boxes next to the entries after loading the table, otherwise they are not active.
